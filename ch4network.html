                    </ul>
                <h2>Network Models</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ul">bus network - All machines are connected to a common comunication line called a bus.</li>
                    <li class="ul2">star network - One machine serves as a central point where all others are connected.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li class="ul">CSMA/CD Ethernet - Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection. It dictates that each message be broadcast to all machines on the bus.</li>

                    <li class="ul2">bridge - More complicated than a repeater, it connects buses, but does not pass all messages. It recognizes the destination addresses of messages, and form a connection when the message is intended for a computer on the other side.</li>
                    <li class="ul3">switch - A bridge with multiple connections, which can connect multiple buses.</li>
                    <li class="ul4">router - The devices which manage the connection between networks which form an internet.</li>
