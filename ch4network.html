                <H2>Network Classifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>LAN - Local area network</li>
                        <li>MAN - Metropolitan area network</li>
                        <li>WAN - Wide area network</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Network Models</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>bus network - All machines are connected to a common comunication line called a bus.</li>
                    <li>star network - One machine serves as a central point where all others are connected.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Protocols</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet - Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection. It dictates that each message be broadcast to all machines on the bus.</li>
                    <li>CSMA/CA wifi - Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance. Commonly referred to as wifi</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Combining Networks:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>repeater - A device which exchanges signals between the two original buses</li>
                    <li>bridge - More complicated than a repeater, it connects buses, but does not pass all messages. It recognizes the destination addresses of messages, and form a connection when the message is intended for a computer on the other side.</li>
                    <li>switch - A bridge with multiple connections, which can connect multiple buses.</li>
                    <li>router - The devices which manage the connection between networks which form an internet.</li>
                    <li>gateway - The location that one network is joined to the internet.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Client/Server Model</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>p2p: peer-to-peer - Client/server model which involves one process providing services to multiple clients.</li>
                    <li>distributed system - Software units that execute as processes on different computers.</li>
                    <li>cloud computing - Large numbers of shared computers on the network can be assigned for client use as needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Internet Addressing</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tier 1 - High-speed, high-capacity, international WANs.</li>
                    <li>Tier 2 - Usually regional, and less capable than Tier 1.</li>
                    <li>Tier 3 - Also called an access. Provides access to the core of redundancy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>IP Address</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a></li>
                    <li>DNS - Domain name system. They are an internet wide directory system of name servers.</li>
                    <li>TLD: Top-level domain - Examples are .edu, .gov, .org, .net, and .com.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/">Country-code TLDs</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Internet Protocols</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP - File Transfer Protocol. It is an application to access a separate computer from a distance.</li>
                    <li>HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It handels web pages.</li>
                    <li>SMTP - Simple Main Transfer Protocol. A methold for town computers to interact on a network when transmitting an email.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>URL - Uniform Resource Locator. It is a unique address given to web documents when retrieving and locating them.</li>

                    <li>spyware - Sometimes called Sniffing, it is a program that collects information about computer activities on the device where it is located, and reports it.</li>
                    <li>phishing - Unlike sniffing, which is secret, phishing consists of asking for information.</li>
                    <li>DDoS attack - Distributed denial of service. It is when the work of geerating attacks is distrbuted across multiple hosts.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>proxy server - It serves as an intermediary between a client and a server, shielding the client from averse server actions.</li>
                    <li>antivirus software - Detects and removes known viruses and infections.</li>
                    <li>cryptography - The study of securely sending and recieving messages in the presence of adversaries. It can use encryption to transform a message into a coded version.</li>
                    <li>public key encryption - Encryption and decryption algorithms are known, and one of the keys is known, but the encoded message is secure.</li>
