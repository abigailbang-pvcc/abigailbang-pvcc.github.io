                Founded in 1849, the U.S. Department of the Interior was created with the goal of managing domestic matters within the United States, containing many roles and responsibilities. Despite possessing a varied list of responsibilities, all the roles of the U.S. department of the Interior where related to development of the nation, or its people. <br>
                <p class="lefttext">
                One of the most well-known elements of the U.S Department of the Interior is the National Park Service.
                Yellowstone National Park became the nation's first National Park in 1872, and in 1883 it became accessible by railroad. This development allowed more public access to the park, and quicker travel. 
            </p>
                <p class="lefttext">
                    The National Park Service was not created until 1916, by President Woodrow Wilson, and Stephen T. Mather became its first director. The land known as Yellowstone National Park has a long history of human involvement, with 11,000 years of human history in the area. Many Native American tribes have been associated with Yellowstone, either living in the region, or traveling through it. The most known tribe affiliated with it is the Tukudika.
