                    <li>Iterative (looping):</li>

                    <li>Binary search:</li>

                <ul><ul>
                    <li>Kinds of tests:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acceptance testing - Confirming whether the entire system is properly functioning</li>
                        <li>Integration testing - Verifying that different components of software or functions are operating together correctly</li>
                        <li>Unit testing - Ensuring that all software units are operating. Units are the smallest testable application component</li>
                        <li>Functional testing - Functions are checked by mimicking buisness scenarios that are based on functional requirements. Black box testing is a common method</li>
                        <li>Performance testing - Verifying how software performs with various workloads. Long testing can be used for real-life load condition performance evaluation.</li>
                        <li>Regression testing - New features are checked to determine whether they will break or fully degrade. Sanity testing is used to verify menus, functions and commands at the surface level if there is no time to perform a full regression test</li>
                        <li>Stress testing - Stress testing evaluates the strain a system is capable of managing successfully, prior to breaking. It is non-functional testing</li>
                        <li>Usability testing - How operable is the system or web appication for the customer to use</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <li>Software testing is done to detect:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a bug or defect can degrade interconnected systems or cause serious malfunctions.</li>
                        <li>companies can save millions per year in development and support if they have a good testing technique</li>
                        <ul><li>Architectural flaws</li>
                            <li>Poor design decisions</li>
                            <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
                            <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
                            <li>Scalability issues</li>

                    <li>Testing best practices</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continuous testing - Each build is tested when it becomes available. It relies on automation that is integrated with the deployment process. Due to the ability to test software in realistic environments early on, it improves the design</li>
                        <li>Configuration management - Allows teams to centrally maintain and track what should be tested. Relevant assets are able to be accessed, and authentication and audit trails are available with good systems to maintain compliance requirements</li>
                        <li>Service virtualization - Simulates services and systems which are incomplete or missing, in order to allow for earlier testing</li>
                        <li>Defect or bug tracking - Automated resources are utilized to monitor defects, and determine their impact, as well as related issues</li>
                        <li>Metrics and reporting - Reporting and analytics allow goeals statuses, and results to be shared among team members, and tools merge metrics and results in a dashboard. The health of a project can be viewed, and relationships between multiple elements can be observed</li>
