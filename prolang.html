                    <ul>
                        <li>Machine language - Machine language is the lowest-level programming language consisting of binary code directly executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).</li><br>
                        <li>Debugging - Identifying and altering errors within the program</li><br>
                        <li>Assembler - turns mnemonic expressions into machine language, allowing humans to use mneumonic form</li><br>
                        <li>Assembly language - collective tern which refers to mneumonic systems representing programs</li><br>
                        <li>Translator - A program capable of translating high-level primitives into machine-language programs after they are identified. They had similarites to second-generation assemblers.</li><br>
                        <li>Compiler - A translation program which compiled multiple machine instructions to create short sequences. They simulated activity that a high-level primitive would request.</li><br>
                        <li>Interpreter - Capable of setting up third-generation languages, it was an alternite option for translators.</li><br>
                        <li>Cross-platform software - Separate from the operating system, it is software which is executable trhoughout the network. It is also separate from the hardware of the machine.</li><br>
                        <li>Natural language - Languages which form gradually over time, without formal grammatical analysis.</li><br>
                        <li>Formal language - Defined by grammars.</li><br>
                        <li>Machine independence - It was largly achieved due to third-generation languages. High-level programming languages offer the programmer more abstractions</li><br>
                        <li>High-level programming language - Offering a greater number of abstractions to the programmer, they are easier to read and write.</li><br>
                        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) - A programmng paradigm which is the object-oriented paradigm. Objects are collected by the software system, and they are able to perform actions relating to themselves. They request actions from other objects, and interact to complete problems.</li><br>
                        <li>Scripting language - Scripting languages constitue a subset of imperative programming languages. They are commonly utilized for administrative tasks rather than the development of complex programs.</li><br>
                        <li>Data types:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="color2">Integer - Numeric data containing whole numbers</li>
                            <li class="color2">Float - Additionally called real, it is numeric data which can contain non whole number values.</li>
                            <li class="color2">String - A string is a sequence of characters, treated as a single data type, commonly used to represent and manipulate textual information.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <li>Primitive data type - A primitive data type in programming is a fundamental, basic value type like integers, floats, or characters.</li><br>
                        <li>Data structure - The way data is organized, and it is frequently linked with program variables.</li><br>
                        <li>Python collection data structures:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li  class="color2">List - A list is a flexible and ordered container for storing and manipulating data.</li>
                            <li  class="color2">Tuple - A tuple is an immutable and ordered collection of elements, often used to group related data. It cannot be altered by the users of the program.</li>
                            <li  class="color2">Set - A set is an unordered collection of modifiable elements.</li>
                            <li  class="color2">Dictionary - A mutable and unordered data type designed to store key-value pairs, where each key must be unique.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <li>Function - Instructions for executing a task, which can be used as an abstract tool.</li><br>
                        <li>Local variable - Declared withen a function, they are not able to be referenced outside on that function.</li><br>
                        <li>Global variable - Not limited to just one section of the program, and can be used outside of one function. They span the whole program.</li><br>
                        <li>Source program - The original form of a program.</li><br>
                        <li>Object program - The translated version of the source program.</li><br>
                    </ul><br><br>
